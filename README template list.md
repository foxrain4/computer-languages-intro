✅ DOs

Use brighter font, the background page of https://www.mazeofdragons.com/ is dark or black
blue links are too dark as well, use white or bright links
Do not use broken code icon, if broken, skip it instead

Use centered, narrow text blocks
Keep paragraphs easy to read with a clean, focused layout.

Add a thematic icon near the top
(e.g., 🌍 for worldbuilding) to set the tone and theme visually.

Use color-coded section headings
Different sections like “Overview,” “Why It Matters,” or “How to Apply It” should use subtle, consistent color variations.

Use real world examples of the topic, but make it sound educational rather than advertising

End with an inspiring prompt or quote
Something that encourages creativity, like “Your world is waiting—start building.”

Include only relevant examples
If the page isn’t about games, skip gaming references entirely.

Use natural markdown-to-HTML styling
Let the site’s CSS handle the final look, but structure content cleanly using headings (##), lists, and quotes.

🚫 DON'Ts

Don’t include broken or placeholder links
Remove or comment out future pages until they’re ready.

Don’t overcrowd the page
Keep it light—2–4 short sections is enough for most intros.
