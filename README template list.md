✅ DOs
Use centered, narrow text blocks
Keep paragraphs easy to read with a clean, focused layout.

Add a thematic icon near the top
(e.g., 🌍 for worldbuilding) to set the tone and theme visually.

Use color-coded section headings
Different sections like “Overview,” “Why It Matters,” or “How to Apply It” should use subtle, consistent color variations.

Keep language educational and approachable
Make it sound like it’s guiding someone gently through learning, not selling or advertising.

End with an inspiring prompt or quote
Something that encourages creativity, like “Your world is waiting—start building.”

Include only relevant examples
If the page isn’t about games, skip gaming references entirely.

Use natural markdown-to-HTML styling
Let the site’s CSS handle the final look, but structure content cleanly using headings (##), lists, and quotes.

🚫 DON'Ts
Don’t use full-width or heavy text blocks
Large, unbroken text walls are harder to read and digest.

Avoid unnecessary bolding or highlighting of game names
Let them flow as examples rather than focal points.

Don’t include broken or placeholder links
Remove or comment out future pages until they’re ready.

Skip unnecessary headers like “Examples in Games” if not relevant
Only include structured sections that fit the topic.

Don’t overcrowd the page
Keep it light—2–4 short sections is enough for most intros.
